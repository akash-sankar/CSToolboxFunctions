# ctrb

## Calling Sequence
- `co = ctrb (sys)`
- `co = ctrb (a, b)`

## Description
The system is controllable if the controllability matrix generated by ctrb _Co = [B AB A<sup>2<#sup>B ... A<sup>n-1<#sup>B]_ has full rank, that is, the rank is equal to the number of states in the state-space model. The controllability matrix Co has Nx rows and Nxu columns.
Return controllability matrix.

**Inputs**

1)sys: LTI model.

2)a: State matrix (n-by-n).

3)b: Input matrix (n-by-m).

**Outputs**

1)co: Controllability matrix.

# covar

## Calling Sequence
- `co = ctrb (sys)`
- `co = ctrb (a, b)`

## Description
Return the steady-state covariance.

covar calculates the stationary covariance of the output y of an LTI model sys driven by Gaussian white noise inputs w. This function handles both continuous- and discrete-time cases.

## Parameters
- `sys`: (State-space): LTI model.
- `w`: Intensity of Gaussian white noise inputs which drive sys.

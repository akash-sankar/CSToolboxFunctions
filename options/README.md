# options

## Calling Sequence
- `co = ctrb (sys)`
- `co = ctrb (a, b)`

## Description
Return controllability matrix.

The system is controllable if the controllability matrix generated by ctrb _Co = [B AB A<sup>2</sup>B ... A<sup>n-1</sup>B]_ has full rank, that is, the rank is equal to the number of states in the state-space model. The controllability matrix Co has Nx rows and Nxu columns.
Return controllability matrix.

## Parameters
- `opt` (struct): Struct with fields for each key.
- `key` (string): The name of the property.
- `value`: The value of the property.

## Examples
1.
```
opt = options ("method", "spa", "tol", 1e-6)
```
```
ans = [struct] with fields:
  string: [struct] with fields:
      method = "spa"
      tol = 1e-6
```
